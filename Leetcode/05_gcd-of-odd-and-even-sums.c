    Problem Link- https://leetcode.com/problems/gcd-of-odd-and-even-sums/description/
    Descriptions- You are given an integer n. Your task is to compute the GCD (greatest common divisor) of two values: 
    sumOdd: the sum of the first n odd numbers.
    sumEven: the sum of the first n even numbers.
    Return the GCD of sumOdd and sumEven.
