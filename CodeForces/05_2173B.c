    Description- Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t(1≤t≤103). The description of 
    the test cases follows. 
    The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤105) — the number of turns. 
    The second line of each test case contains nintegers a1,a2,…,an(−109≤ai≤109).
    The third line of each test case contains n integers b1,b2,…,bn(−109≤bi≤109).
    It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 105.
